## Creating & Logging into an Account:
* If it is your first time using this app then just enter a valid email and a password that contains at least 8 charecters with at least one number and no special characters.
* Once you create an account your login information should be stored in CoreData and you should be automatically logged in everytime you open the app.
* If you are not logged into your account automatically, for whatever reason, then just enter in your existing account information and you should be logged back into your existing account.

## Location Use:
* If you do not enable your location use then you will need to visit the settings page and manually enter in your address before you'll be able to load election and representative data.
* If you allow the app to use your location then you won't need to manually set your address but you can if you'd like. If you decide to manually enter your address the load data page will use that new address; however, if you leave and come back up the app then your manually entered address will be overwritten with your current loaction if the app still has permission to use it.

## Loading Current Officials and Election Info:
* If it is your first time using the app then you will need to load your election and representative data by selecting the load data button in the top left corner of the app.
* If you ever feel that your election or represenative data is out of date then feel free to reload the data and your old election and represenative information will be overwritten with the current information.
